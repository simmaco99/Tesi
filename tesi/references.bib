ABSTRACT = { (1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection. }

title = {Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations: Steady-State and Time-Dependent Problems (Classics in Applied Mathematics Classics in Applied Mathemat)},
year = {2007},
isbn = {0898716292},
publisher = {Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This book introduces finite difference methods for both ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) and discusses the similarities and
differences between algorithm design and stability analysis for different types of
equations. A unified view of stability theory for ODEs and PDEs is presented, and
the interplay between ODE and PDE analysis is stressed. The text emphasizes standard
classical methods, but several newer approaches also are introduced and are described
in the context of simple motivating examples. The book is organized into two main
sections and a set of appendices. Part I addresses steady-state boundary value problems,
starting with two-point boundary value problems in one dimension, followed by coverage
of elliptic problems in two and three dimensions. It concludes with a chapter on iterative
methods for large sparse linear systems that emphasizes systems arising from difference
approximations. Part II addresses time-dependent problems, starting with the initial
value problem for ODEs, moving on to initial boundary value problems for parabolic
and hyperbolic PDEs, and concluding with a chapter on mixed equations combining features
of ODEs, parabolic equations, and hyperbolic equations. The appendices cover concepts
pertinent to Parts I and II. Exercises and student projects, developed in conjunction
with this book, are available on the book s webpage along with numerous MATLAB m-files.
Readers will gain an understanding of the essential ideas that underlie the development,
analysis, and practical use of finite difference methods as well as the key concepts
of stability theory, their relation to one another, and their practical implications.
The author provides a foundation from which students can approach more advanced topics
and further explore the theory and/or use of finite difference methods according to
their interests and needs. Audience This book is designed as an introductory graduate-level
textbook on finite difference methods and their analysis. It is also appropriate for
researchers who desire an introduction to the use of these methods. Contents Preface;

 abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},
